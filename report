Program:
I used a final function with the name getInput to create game menu. In this menu all facilities of the homework except playVector function
can be tested. playVector function also can be selected from the main menu that is constructed in main function.

Input Type:
The moving inputs in my homework must be typed as 2bd which means down the object in 2b location to down. Uppercase letters are allowed.

Score Functions:
The score functions of the games are special for every game. The best score is 0 for all of them.
For peg solitaire the score is calculated by subtracting 1 from the number of remaining pegs.
For eight puzzle every number that is on the right place subtracts one from 8 which is the worst case.
For klotski if any character that 2*2 object has takes it's place, then the function subtracts 1 one from 4 which is the worst case
If the game is terminated before it is over the score is printed.

playVector and autoAll Functions:
Peg solitaire can be solved in a short time but for other games this is not possible. So in playVector and autoAll functions the program
works to finish the games for a long time. I could solve this problem by not printing the current boards but to show that the function
is working the program prints the current boards.
